# This DEPS file checks out a writable copy of the Chromium buildbot code at
# HEAD, rather than the read-only copy at a known-good revision (as checked out
# by the default DEPS file).
#
# Thus, this DEPS file is useful for:
#  - developers who wish to make changes to the underlying Chromium buildbot
#    repository and see their effects on the Skia buildbot
#
# To check out the Skia buildbot code using this DEPS-developer file, run:
#  gclient config https://skia.googlecode.com/svn/buildbot \
#          --deps-file=DEPS-developer
#  gclient sync
