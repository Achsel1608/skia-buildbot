How to create new instances
===========================

Ensure gcutil is available on your PATH by running `gcutil --help` and following
instructions if you do not get a help message.

Every command takes an instance name as an argument. If no instance name is
provided, it will output the available instance names and exit.
The number and name of instances that can be created is fixed. To add a new
instance edit the vm_config.sh script.

To create a GCE instance it is necessary for a persistent disk to already exist.
This happens either by re-using the disk of a deleted instance or creating a new
persistent dist.

Here are the commands available:

- vm_create_disk.sh  instancename
Creates a persistent disks for use with the specified instance. This assumes
that the disk does not currently exist.

- vm_delete_disk.sh instancename
Deletes the disk for the given instance. This will only succeed if the disk
is currently not attached to the running instance.

- vm_create_instance.sh instancename
Creates a new instance. This assumes that the instance does not currently exist
and that the persistent disk exists and is not attached to any other instance.
This will also create a boot disk for the instance.

- vm_delete_instance.sh instancename
Shutdown and delete the specified instance.
This will only delete the boot disk, but not any persistent disk attached to
the instance.

Examples:

These commands will create the 'prod' instance from scratch:

   $ ./vm_create_disk prod
   $ ./vm_create_instance prod

These commands will re-create the existing 'prod' instance, but keep the
persistent disk:

   $ ./vm_delete_instance prod
   $ ./vm_create_instance prod
