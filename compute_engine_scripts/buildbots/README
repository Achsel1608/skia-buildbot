to /tmp.

The following are a few examples-
To create windows swarming bots:
- VM_INSTANCE_OS=Windows \
  VM_BOT_COUNT_START=16 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=19 bash vm_create_setup_instances.sh
To create linux swarming bots:
- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_create_persistent_disks.sh
- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_create_setup_instances.sh

To create other kinds of bots:
- VM_IS_ANDROID_MERGE=1 VM_INSTANCE_OS=Linux \
  SKIA_BOT_MACHINE_TYPE=n1-standard-16 VM_BOT_COUNT_START=14 \
  VM_BOT_COUNT_END=14 bash vm_create_persistent_disks.sh
- VM_IS_ANDROID_MERGE=1 VM_INSTANCE_OS=Linux \
  SKIA_BOT_MACHINE_TYPE=n1-standard-16 VM_BOT_COUNT_START=14 \
  VM_BOT_COUNT_END=14 bash vm_create_setup_instances.sh

Access instances
================

Run `gcloud compute ssh chrome-bot@skia-vm-NNN`. Find the correct zone at

How to delete old instances
===========================

Windows does not have an external persistent disk thus can skip the
vm_delete_persistent_disks.sh call below for Windows.

- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_delete_instances.sh
- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_delete_persistent_disks.sh
