Skia's GCE buildbot machines.

Migrating instances before PCRs
===============================

The instances should be moved using the scripts in this directory a few weeks
before a PCR is scheduled. We are allowed instances in the us-central1-a and
us-central1-b zones and will alternate between zone tags 'a' and 'b' during
PCRs.

The scripts should be executed in this order:
* ZONE_TAG=$NEW_ZONE vm_create_master.sh
* ZONE_TAG=$NEW_ZONE vm_setup_master.sh
* ZONE_TAG=$OLD_ZONE vm_delete_slaves.sh
* ZONE_TAG=$NEW_ZONE vm_create_slaves.sh
* ZONE_TAG=$NEW_ZONE vm_setup_slaves.sh
* ZONE_TAG=$NEW_ZONE vm_copy_buildbot_history.sh  (Run this overnight, it takes a while)
* ZONE_TAG=$OLD_ZONE vm_delete_master.sh

After the above scripts are run, update gce_compile_bots_zone in
global_variables.json to point to the $NEW_ZONE.
