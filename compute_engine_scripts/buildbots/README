If you haven't already, install Cloud SDK from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/.

Run `sudo apt-get install tofrodos`.

to /tmp.

The following are a few examples-
To create windows swarming bots:
- VM_INSTANCE_OS=Windows \
  VM_BOT_COUNT_START=16 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=19 bash vm_create_setup_instances.sh
To create linux swarming bots:
- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_create_persistent_disks.sh
- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_create_setup_instances.sh

To create other kinds of bots:
- VM_IS_CTBOT=1 VM_BOT_COUNT_START=211 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=212 \
  bash vm_create_persistent_disks.sh
- VM_IS_CTBOT=1 VM_BOT_COUNT_START=211 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=212 \
  bash vm_create_setup_instances.sh

Access instances
================

Run `gcloud compute ssh chrome-bot@skia-vm-NNN`. Find the correct zone at

How to delete old instances
===========================

Windows does not have an external persistent disk thus can skip the
vm_delete_persistent_disks.sh call below for Windows.

- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_delete_instances.sh
- VM_BOT_COUNT_START=20 VM_BOT_COUNT_END=22 bash vm_delete_persistent_disks.sh
