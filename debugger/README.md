Skia Debugger
=============

The Skia Debugger consists of two components, the C++ command-line application
that ingests SKPs and analyzes them, and the HTML/CSS/JS front-end to the
debugger that is loaded off of https://debugger.skia.org. This directory
contains the code for debugger.skia.org.

See `DESIGN.md` for more details.
