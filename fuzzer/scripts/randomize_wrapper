# randomize_wrapper takes the hash of the fuzz as its first argument, and additional arguments t
# be passed to the build fuzz executable.  Then it:
#
# 1) runs randomize_gyp to create the gyp file
# 2) runs randomize_ninja to build the executable
# 3) runs randomize_run to generate the output .png file.
#
# the output PNG file goes into the inout directory, which is shared between the chroot
# jail and the webserver environment.
